# Alexandria Website Layout Specification

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive specification for the Alexandria website layout based on the provided mockup. The design features a sophisticated, academic aesthetic with clear typography, ample whitespace, and a balanced visual hierarchy.

  - Vertical padding to align with the top of the right column content

- **Right Column (Content)**:
  - Contains placeholder lorem ipsum text
  - Multiple paragraphs of body text
  - Font size approximately 1rem
  - Line height approximately 1.5-1.6
  - Text color: dark gray or black

  - Vertical line separator between left and right columns

- **Manifesto Link**:
  - Placed below the lorem ipsum text in the right column
  - Text: "Welcome back to Alexandria. Read the entire manifesto →"
  - Font size slightly smaller than body text (approximately 0.9rem)
  - Includes right arrow symbol indicating action
  - Subtle emphasis on this text (possibly italics or different weight)
  - Properly spaced from the content above (margin-top approximately 1rem)

## Horizontal Separator
- Thin horizontal line spanning the full content width
- Light gray color
- Margin above and below (approximately 2rem)
- Serves as visual division between content sections

## Two-Column Content Section (Second)
- **Left Column (Images)**:
  - Collage of 4 distinct images arranged in a golden spiral pattern:
    - Large image (61.8% of container): A computer chip or electronic component held in a hand
    - Medium image (23.6% of container): Muhammad Ali boxing image
    - Small image (9.1% of container): Scientific image of black hole
    - Smallest image (5.5% of container): Portrait photograph with red scarf
  - Images flow clockwise in decreasing size following golden ratio proportions
  - Small gaps between images (0.25rem) maintaining spiral flow
  - Column takes approximately 40-45% of the content width
  - Images contained within rounded rectangle container
  - Layout creates natural visual flow following golden spiral mathematics

- **Right Column (Content)**:
  - Contains placeholder lorem ipsum text
  - Similar styling to the first content section
  - Font size approximately 1rem
  - Line height approximately 1.5-1.6
  - Text aligned to the left
  - Occupies approximately 55-60% of the content width
  - Properly spaced from the image grid (margin-left approximately 1.5-2rem)

## Second Horizontal Separator
- Identical styling to the first separator
- Thin horizontal line spanning the full content width
- Light gray color
- Margin above and below (approximately 2rem)

## Full-Width Image Section
- Large landscape image showing a majestic tree on a hillside
- Full content width with small margins on sides (matching other sections)
- Rounded corners (approximately 0.5rem border radius)
- Height approximately 35-40vh
- High-quality image with good resolution and natural lighting

## Footer Navigation
- Four text links horizontally arranged:
  - "Enter Alexandria"
  - "Manifesto"
  - "About Us"
  - "Changelog"
- Even spacing between links
- Centered alignment within the content area
- Font size approximately 1rem
- Font weight: medium
- Proper padding above and below (approximately 2rem above, 3rem below)
- No underlines on links in default state (likely underline on hover)

## General Styling Notes
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Predominantly black text on white/off-white background
  - Minimal use of colors except in images
  - Possible accent colors derived from the imagery
  - High contrast for readability

- **Typography**:
  - Serif font for the Alexandria logo
  - Sans-serif font for body text and navigation
  - Clear hierarchy in font sizing between different elements
  - Consistent line heights throughout

- **Spacing and Layout**:
  - Consistent margins on the sides (approximately 1-1.5rem)
  - Generous whitespace between sections
  - Balanced visual weight across the page
  - Content appears to have a maximum width constraint

## Responsive Considerations
- On smaller screens:
  - Header should stack elements vertically
  - Two-column layouts should collapse to single column
  - Font sizes should adjust proportionally
  - Navigation in footer should remain accessible
  - Images should scale appropriately while maintaining aspect ratios

## Interactions and Animations
- Hover states for all clickable elements
- Smooth transitions for any interactive elements
- Possible subtle animations for page load

## Accessibility Considerations
- All images should have appropriate alt text
- Navigation should be fully keyboard accessible
- Sufficient color contrast for all text elements
- Semantic HTML structure (headings, landmarks, etc.)
- Focus states for interactive elements

This specification should be used as a reference for implementing the website layout, with the understanding that some design decisions may need to be refined during development.
